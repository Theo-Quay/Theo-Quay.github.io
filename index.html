    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Theo, a natural sciences student passionate about chemistry. 
       I'm currently in my fourth and last year of university at UCL, set to graduate with a masters in natural sciences.
       More specifically, I am majoring in materials and inorganic chemistry, and minoring in physics.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Theo-Quay/sentinel-unsupervised-segmentation-Earth">Satellite imagery unsupervised segmentation mapping - 2024</a></h3>
      <p>Understanding the Earth's surface is vital to udnerstadning the planet, and this involves the identificationa and classification of features.
        In this project, an unsupervised single-scene learning model developed by Saha et al, 2022, was used to create segmentation maps of Earth sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
        The project was a continuation of previous work done by Hamish Mitchell's group (whamitch@mit.edu) in training unsupervised learning models on Mars satellite imagery. I created a pipeline in python integrating the process of requesting and downloading satellite imagery with Sentinel Hub API, with the segmentation of said images using the unsupervised learning model mentioned previously.
        While Saha's model was originally developed with RGB imagery in mind, my code allows for easier investigation on how changing the number and type of sentinel-1 & 2 bands the model runs on can affect how the image is segmented and what features are identified and separated. This was confirmed via tests using MIT SuperCloud.
        The pipeline will allow for memebrs of Hamish and Gaia's teams to easily anaylse Earth satellite imagery using single-scene segmentation models, regardless of the kind of observation satellite data and self-supervised model beign used, or geographical/urban features being categorised.
        This project was done in collaboration with W. Hamish Mitchell and Gaia Stucky de Quay (gaias@mit.edu) through MIT.

    <h3>Vacancy-ordered Double Perovskites - 2023</h3>
  
    <article class="research">
      <h3></h3>
      <p>My research at UCL entailed the analysis of x-ray degradation of lead-free halide perovskites with applications in optoelectronics using various analytical techniques. The aim of this research was to expand on Robert Palgrave's group's knowledge on halide perovskites, specifically A<sub>2</sub>BX<sub>6</sub> vacancy ordered double perovskites, under the guidance of Prajna Bhatt (PhD student) and Anna Regoutz (Professor, placement supervisor). 
        In my eight weeks at the UCL Chemistry Department, I was able to:
        <ul>
          <li>Synthesise and obtain brand-new crystallographic data for triclinic FA<sub>2</sub>SnBr<sub>6</sub> using PXRD;</li>
          <li>Synthesise cubic-phase (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SnBr<sub>6</sub>;</li>
          <li>Create a phase series between both crystals by doping FA (FA =  HCN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) into the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SnBr<sub>6</sub> structure;</li>
          <li>Use XPS to measure the analytical doping percentages of the aforementioned series;</li>
          <li>Measure direct and indirect band gaps for the substances synthesised;</li>
          <li>Collect x-ray radiation damage data on our doped series, using .</li></ul>
        Overall, this research opportunity significantly developed my skills as an inorganic and analytical chemist. It expanded my knowledge on crystallography, band gap theory, analytical techniques and more.
        Moreover, I had the unique opportunity to spend 2 days undertaking XPS measurements with members of Anna's team at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron. This was the highlight of the placement, as I was able to assist in high-impact chemical analysis of thin-film samples at  a fantastic scientific institution.
        <br>This research was made possible by the ACTF undergraduate research bursary.
