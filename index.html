    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Theo, a natural sciences student passionate about chemistry. 
       I'm currently in my fourth and last year of university at UCL, set to graduate in June with a masters in natural sciences.
       More specifically, I am majoring in materials and inorganic chemistry, and minoring in physics.
       I value experiencing and incorporating a wide range of perspectives and ideas in my life and work. This is one of the reasons I decided to study an interdisciplinary course such as natural sciences.
       Furthermore, I also draw from having studied in the US, UK and Portugal, as well as from my Portuguese, Spanish and Brazilian family background.
       Outside of university you will most likely find me playing rugby or football, or reading a book (suggestionas are always appreciated).
       I will keep updating this website as I gain more experiences and involve myself in more projects. Stay tuned for more!</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Theo-Quay/sentinel-unsupervised-segmentation-Earth">Satellite imagery unsupervised segmentation mapping - 2024</a></h3>
      <p>Understanding the Earth's surface is vital to understanding the planet, and this involves the identification and classification of features. Current labelling of the Earth's surface is extremely time-consuming, and AI tools can help us speed up this process.
        In this project, an unsupervised single-scene learning model developed by Saha et al, 2022, was used to create segmentation maps of Earth sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
        The project was a continuation of previous work done by Hamish Mitchell's group (whamitch@mit.edu). I created a pipeline in python integrating the process of requesting and downloading satellite imagery with Sentinel Hub API, with the segmentation of said images using the unsupervised learning model mentioned previously.
        While Saha's model was originally developed with RGB imagery in mind, my code allows for easier investigation on how changing the number and type of sentinel-1 & 2 bands the model runs on can affect how the image is segmented and what features are identified and separated. This was confirmed via tests using MIT SuperCloud.
        The pipeline will allow for memebrs of Hamish and Gaia's teams to easily anaylse Earth satellite imagery using single-scene segmentation models, regardless of the kind of observation satellite data and self-supervised model beign used, or geographical/urban features being categorised. This will help with researching and classifying Earth surface data.
        This project was done in collaboration with W. Hamish Mitchell and Gaia Stucky de Quay (gaias@mit.edu) through MIT.

    <h3>MSci Project - Growth and Exfoliation of Bismuth Oxyiodide Sheets</h3>
  
    <article class="research">
      <h3></h3>
      <p>Bismuth oxyhalides are materials capable of photocatalysis for water splitting, degradation of pollutants, and photoreduction of CO2.
        BiOI crystals, like graphite, contain strong bonds between atoms in a single layer, but weak Van der Waals interlayer forces.
        I am currently undertaking a masters project at UCL into the exfoliation of single BiOI sheets using mechanical or chemical methods.
        These will then be characterised/analysed using several spectroscopic analytical tools, XRD, SEM, TEM, and conductivity measurements.
        The photocatalytic capabilties of the sheets synthesised will then be compared to its powder form.
        Possible additional avenues of investigation include improving our sybthesis ethods to allow for subsitution of the Bi and halide sites.
        Attempting deposotion of thin layers onto substrates, like graphite or silicon, is also of interest.

    <h3>Vacancy-ordered Double Perovskites - 2023</h3>
  
    <article class="research">
      <h3></h3>
      <p>Finding sustainable energy alternatives to combat climate change is becoming increasingly imperative. One solution is in solar energy, specifically perovksite solar cells which have shown extremely promising efficiencies and lower prices.
        Most current perovksite cells beign research contain lead, a toxic chemical. Lead-free alternatives, such as those containing tin, are of interest if perovskite solar cells are to be implemented in a larger scale. 
        My research at UCL entailed the analysis of x-ray degradation of lead-free halide perovskites with applications in optoelectronics using various analytical techniques. The aim of this research was to expand on Robert Palgrave's group's knowledge on halide perovskites, specifically A<sub>2</sub>BX<sub>6</sub> vacancy ordered double perovskites, under the guidance of Prajna Bhatt (PhD student) and Anna Regoutz (Professor, placement supervisor). 
        In my eight weeks at the UCL Chemistry Department, I was able to:
        <ul>
          <li>Synthesise and obtain brand-new crystallographic data for triclinic FA<sub>2</sub>SnBr<sub>6</sub> using PXRD;</li>
          <li>Synthesise cubic-phase (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SnBr<sub>6</sub>;</li>
          <li>Create a phase series between both crystals by doping FA (FA =  HCN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) into the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SnBr<sub>6</sub> structure;</li>
          <li>Use XPS to measure the analytical doping percentages of the aforementioned series;</li>
          <li>Measure direct and indirect band gaps for the substances synthesised;</li>
          <li>Collect x-ray radiation damage data on our doped series using XPS.</li></ul>
        Overall, this research opportunity significantly developed my skills as an inorganic and analytical chemist. It expanded my knowledge on crystallography, band gap theory, analytical techniques and more. It also contributed to the field of perovskite solar cell technology.
        Moreover, I had the unique opportunity to spend 2 days undertaking XPS measurements with members of Anna's team at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron. This was the highlight of the placement, as I was able to assist in high-impact chemical analysis of thin-film samples at  a fantastic scientific institution.
        <br>This research was made possible by the ACTF undergraduate research bursary.
