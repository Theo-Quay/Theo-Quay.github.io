    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Theo, a natural sciences student passionate about chemistry. 
       I'm currently in my fourth and last year of university at UCL, set to graduate with a masters in natural sciences.
       More specifically, I am majoring in materials and inorganic chemistry, and minoring in physics.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Theo-D-Q/sentinel-unsupervised-segmentation-Earth">Satellite imagery unsupervised segmentation mapping - 2024</a></h3>
      <p>In this project, an unsupervised learning model developed by Saha et al, 2022, was used to create segmentation maps of Earth sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
        The goal of this project was to create a python pipeline integrating the process of requesting and downloading satellite imagery from the sentinelhub API, with the segmentation of said images using an unsupervised learning program developed previously.
        While Saha's model was orignally developed with RGB imagery in mind, my code allows for easier investigation on how changing the sentinel-1 & 2 bands the model runs on can affect how the image in segmented.
        This project was done in collaboration with W. Hamish Mitchell (whamitch@mit.edu) and Gaia Stucky de Quay (gaias@mit.edu) through MIT.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <h2>Vacancy-ordered Double Perovskites - 2023</h2>
  
    <article class="research">
      <h3></h3>
      <p>My research at entailed the analysis of x-ray degradation of lead-free halide perovskites with applications in optoelectronics using various analytical techniques. The aim of this research was to expand on Robert Palgrave’s group’s knowledge on halide perovskites, specifically A<sub>2</sub>BX<sub>6</sub> vacancy ordered double perovskites, under the guidance of Prajna Bhatt (PhD student) and Anna Regoutz (Professor, placement supervisor). 
        In my eight weeks at the UCL Chemistry Department, I was able to:
        <ul>
          <li>synthesise and obtain brand-new crystallographic data for triclinic FA<sub>2</sub>SnBr<sub>6</sub> using PXRD;</li>
          <li>b) synthesise cubic-phase (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SnBr<sub>6</sub>;</li>
          <li>c) create a phase series between both crystals by doping FA (FA =  HCN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) into the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SnBr<sub>6</sub> structure;</li>
          <li>d) use XPS to measure the analytical doping percentages of the aforementioned series;</li>
          <li>e) measure direct and indirect band gaps for the substances synthesised;</li>
          <li>f) collect x-ray radiation damage data on certain samples.</li>
          <li>Overall, this research opportunity significantly developed my skills as an inorganic and analytical chemist. It expanded my knowledge on crystallography, band gap theory, analytical techniques and more.</li>
          <li>This research was made possible by the ACTF undergraduate research bursary. </li>
